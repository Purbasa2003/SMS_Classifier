## SMS_Classifier

Project Description

This project involves the development of a classification model to categorize SMS messages as either spam or not spam. Leveraging data science techniques in Python, the project aims to provide an effective solution for spam detection.

Tools and Technologies Used

- *Google Colaboratory*: Used for initial code development and execution.
- *Visual Studio Code*: Utilized for code refinement and further development.

Data Science Techniques

The following data science techniques were employed to develop the classification model:

1. *Data Preprocessing*: Cleaning and preparing the SMS data for analysis, including handling missing values and converting text to a suitable format.
2. *Feature Extraction*: Utilizing techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform text data into numerical features.
3. *Model Selection and Training*:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Decision Trees
4. *Model Evaluation*: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Optimizing model parameters to enhance performance.
6. *Cross-Validation*: Ensuring the robustness of the model through cross-validation.
